  advisor: "Head of Strategy"
  priority: "high"
  condition: "party_stats.narrative_coherence < 0.4"
  message: "Our narrative is fracturing. The story we're telling has too many contradictions. We need to consolidate our messaging immediately."
  message_cynical: "The story's falling apart. People notice when you contradict yourself. Time to pick a lane and stick to it—or lean into the chaos."

  message_cynical: "The story's steady enough for now. But voters remember when you slip. Keep the contradictions subtle."

  condition: "party_stats.faction_integrity < 0.3"
  message: "The coalition is splintering. Key factions are pulling in different directions. This unity cannot hold without immediate action."
  message_cynical: "Your coalition's a house of cards. Different groups want different things—as usual. Either give them a common enemy or watch it collapse."

  advisor: "Moral Strategist"
  priority: "high"
  condition: "party_stats.moral_conditioning_index > 0.7"
  message: "The public's moral framework is heavily conditioned. This is powerful, but dangerous—it creates brittle loyalty. One contradiction could shatter everything."
  message_cynical: "You've got them trained. High loyalty, but fragile. They believe what you need them to believe. One slip-up and the whole thing collapses."

  advisor: "Faction Liaison"
  priority: "high"
  condition: "party_stats.narrative_coherence < 0.4 && party_stats.faction_integrity < 0.3"
  message: "CRITICAL: We are experiencing simultaneous narrative collapse and faction breakdown. Both our story and our coalition are failing. This is existential."
  message_cynical: "You're losing on both fronts—story and structure. The organization is fragmenting and the message is contradictory. This needs immediate attention."

  priority: "medium"
  condition: "party_stats.moral_conditioning_index > 0.5 && party_stats.narrative_coherence < 0.6"
  message: "WARNING: High moral conditioning combined with narrative inconsistency is dangerous. Voters expect moral clarity from us—confusion will cause severe backlash."
  message_cynical: "You've trained them to expect moral clarity from you. Contradiction now hits twice as hard. Be careful."
